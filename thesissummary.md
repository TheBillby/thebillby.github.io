<h1>Summary</h1>
I argue that the current copyright system does not strike an ideal balance between public access to works and incentives for creators to make those works. I propose an alternative: a “monopoly marketplace” where creators choose only the monopolies that they want and only for the durations that they want.
<h1>Rationale</h1>
Creative and informative works cost time, money and energy to make

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-509" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2016.png" width="300" height="300" />

... but practically nothing to distribute...

<img src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%202.png" alt="image 2" width="300" height="300" />

Ideally, anyone would be able to distribute and adapt works, which would maximise a work's benefit.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-500" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%203.png" alt="image 3" width="300" height="128" />

But if anyone can sell or distribute a work, why buy it from the creator?

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-501" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%204.png" alt="image 4" width="300" height="300" />

And if you're not getting paid to create, why create?

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-502" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%205.png" alt="image 5" width="300" height="300" />

If I receive the benefit of something  whether or not I contribute to its creation/maintenance, I will be better off if I do not contribute.

But if enough people think like that, the thing is not created or maintained, and I am worse off than if I (and everyone else) contributed.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-503" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%206.png" alt="image 6" width="300" height="103" />

There are a number of ways of providing public goods while avoiding the free rider problem described above.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-504" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%207.png" alt="image 7" width="300" height="106" />

And <strong>artificial scarcity</strong>. Give creators a de jure monopoly, and people are no longer contributing to a public good. They're purchasing a single item. Their choice becomes much simpler:

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-505" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%208.png" alt="image 8" width="300" height="75" />

That's the approach taken by the current copyright system. It is predicated on the assumption that:
Unlimited access to fewer works is worse than limited access to more works.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-506" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%209.png" alt="image 9" width="300" height="62" />

In fact, there's a few more factors we need to weigh up:
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Without copyright</em></p>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-523 size-large" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2012.png" alt="image 12" width="660" height="85" />
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>With copyright</em></p>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-524 size-large" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2011.png?w=660" alt="image 11" width="660" height="92" />

What if we could reform the system so that more works exist or are available, access is less limited, deadweight losses are lower and our civil liberties are less infringed upon?

<h1>Proposed reforms</h1>
<h2>Shorter terms</h2>
Copyright currently runs for 70 years after the death of the author.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-508 size-large" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2014.png" alt="image 14" width="660" height="457" />

Studies into the optimal copyright term have suggested terms like 2 years or 15 years.
If the copyright term were 15 years, currently in the public domain would be:

<h3>Books</h3>

<em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em>
</blockquote>
<h2>Require registration</h2>
Currently, copyright arises automatically, which means that many works are subject to copyright even though their creators are happy for them to be shared - or they remain subject to copyright many years after the creator has ceased to care if they are shared
<h2>A fee</h2>
When the government takes or damages private property for the public good, it pays the owner of the property. By extension, when a citizen takes a public good and turns it into a private monopoly - which is what happens with copyright - they should pay the public.
<h2>Limited scope</h2>
Copyright would be limited to verbatim copying of a work. If you wanted to build up, adapt, translate, perform, transform, create a collage from, etc., a work, that would be acceptable.

<h1>The Monopoly Marketplace</h1>
<h2>Step One:</h2>
Create the work.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-509" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2016.png" alt="image 16" width="300" height="300" />
<h2>Step Two:</h2>
Distribute it however you like
<blockquote>
<h3>Rule 1</h3>
Automatic complete copyright protection for the first year after publication</blockquote>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-510" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2017.png?w=300" alt="image 17" width="300" height="300" />
<h2>Step Three:</h2>
After a year, assess the work and make a few decisions:

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-511" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2018.png" alt="image 18" width="300" height="159" /></a>
<blockquote>
<h3>Rule 2</h3>
The copyright registration is the definitive source of who the creators are, where to contact them, what the copyright conditions are, etc.

If you sell the copyright monopoly to another, this must be recorded along with the registration.

The registered copy or copies of the work are the definitive ones.</blockquote>
<h2>Step Four:</h2>
Decide how extensively you want to limit access to the work:
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-512 size-full" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2019.png" alt="image 19" width="142" height="142" />
Do not register it/Register it as unlimited</h3>
No copyright protection exists.
<h3><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-513" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2020.png" alt="image 20" width="231" height="165" /></a>Libre limitation</h3>
The only limits that apply to this work are moral conditions (see below).

<strong>Fee:</strong> None.
<strong>Duration:</strong> Until your death.
<h3><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-514" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2021.png" alt="image 21" width="231" height="166" />Partial limitation</h3>
Copying the work is forbidden, but performing the work or adapting it (like writing a sequel, turning it into a stage play, sampling the song in your own song, etc.) is legal.

Also can have moral conditions attached.

<strong>Fee:</strong> Annual renewal fee of $50, plus 5% of the revenue you make from the creative work.
<strong>Duration:</strong> 28 years.
<h3><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-515" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2022.png" alt="image 22" width="142" height="142" />Full limitation</h3>
The work cannot be reproduced, copied, adapted, performed, etc. Very similar to current copyright.

Moral conditions are redundant.

<strong>Fee:</strong> Annual renewal fee of $50, plus 5% of the revenue you make from the creative work.
<strong>Duration:</strong> 14 years.
<h2>Step Five:</h2>
Decide what other conditions you want attached to the work.

(These are conditions that do not limit who can use the work or what they can use it for, they just place conditions around the use of the work).

**Duration:** Life of the author  
**Fee:** None, but must be renewed every 10 years

Give reasonable credit to the creator
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-518 size-thumbnail" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2023.png" alt="rect2991-4-2-1" width="150" height="150" /></a>Non-association</h3>
Re-uses of the work must not promote the work by using the name of the creator or the title of the original work

Re-uses of the work must be available to all people at no cost, such as through a free download
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-519 size-thumbnail" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/rect2991-4-2-1-8.png?w=150" alt="rect2991-4-2-1-8" width="150" height="150" />Information</h3>
The creator must be told when the work is being re-used and a copy given to the creator on request
<h3><img class="alignnone wp-image-522 size-thumbnail" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/text7156.png?w=150" alt="text7156" width="150" height="150" />Shared source</h3>
Re-uses of the work must make the read-write source files of the work available
<h2> Examples</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-515" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2022.png" alt="image 22" width="142" height="142" />We made a movie. It'll open in cinemas, move to DVD within a year, appear on free to air TV within a few years, have a brief merchandising burst and have made the vast majority of its earnings in the first five years. The full limitation is ideal for us.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-530 size-thumbnail" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/3.png" alt="3" width="150" height="109" />I'm an academic. I get tenure if enough people read and cite my papers. I want practically nothing to get in the way of that - except I'd like to know when my paper is used so I can tell the dean!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-531 size-thumbnail" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/4.png" alt="4" width="150" height="97" />I'm a musician. Buy my album - don't download it! But if you want to play my songs in the pub or sample a beat in your own songs, go for it!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-512" src="http://thebillby.github.io/images/thesis_summary/image%2019.png" alt="image 19" width="142" height="142" />That Facebook status update I just made? Yeah, that's not going to need copyright protection.
